# 5.1 Updating Variables

# Example 1 - Updating a variable
# Before we can update a variable, we have to initialize it, with a simple assignment.

# declare a variable called x and assign it a value of 0
x = 0
# Tn this example I update variable x by adding 1 to it and then store the value back in x
x = x + 1
# display the value stored in variable x in the console.
print(x)
