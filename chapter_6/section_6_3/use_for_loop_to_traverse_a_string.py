# Chapter 6 - Strings
# 6.3 Traversal through a string with a loop

# File: use_for_loop_to_traverse_a_string.py
# Description - In this example I traverse a string using a for loop
# and display each letter on a line by itself.

# Declare a variable called fruit and assign it a string of watermelon.
fruit = 'watermelon'

#----- for loop -----
# Iterate through each character in the fruit string directly.
# The iteration variable in this loop is called letter.
# The for loop iterates through the string saved in variable fruit and saves it
# in variable letter each iteration. After each iteration the for loop prints the letter.
# After the last letter in the string the for loop exits.
for letter in fruit:
    # Print the current letter to the console.
    print(letter)
#----- for loop -----
